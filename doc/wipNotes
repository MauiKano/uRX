Shortwave Frequency:         4209.5kHz
Mediumwave Frequency english: 518kHz
Mediumwave Frequence local:   490 kHz

Test case constructions:

1. Set fldigi to NAVTEX Mode 

    Open fldigi.
    Navigate to the Op Mode menu.
    Select NAVTEX or SITOR-B. (Both use the same underlying SITOR-B protocol, but the NAVTEX mode includes automatic headers). 

2. Configure the Audio Output to a File 

    Go to the File menu and select Audio.
    Select TX Generate.
    A window will prompt you to choose a save location and name for your new .wav file. 

3. Prepare and Transmit Your Message

    Center Frequency: Ensure your waterfall cursor is centered at 1000 Hz (standard for SITOR-B/NAVTEX audio).
    Compose Message: Type your test message in the blue (lower) typing pane. For a valid NAVTEX message, use the standard format:
        Start: ZCZC followed by a space and a 4-character ID (e.g., ZCZC PA01).
        Body: Your test text.
        End: NNNN on a new line.
    Execute TX: Press the T/R button (or Ctrl-T).
        Fldigi will automatically precede your message with several seconds of the required phasing signal.
        The software will then encode each character twice for FEC.
        Once the message finishes, press the T/R button again (or use the ^r shortcut at the end of your text) to stop the recording. 

4. Verify the Signal

    Uncheck TX Generate in the File menu.
    Go to File > Audio > Playback and select your newly created file.
    If generated correctly, fldigi should be able to decode its own signal on the waterfall. 

5. Using the File in SDRangel
When feeding this .wav file into your File Channel Source in SDRangel, remember to match the sample rate: 

    Sample Rate: Fldigi typically records at your sound card's rate (e.g., 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz).
    Interpolation: You must set the Interpolation (S) factor in SDRangel to scale this rate up to your hardware's rate (e.g., if playing a 48 kHz file through a 2 MHz LimeSDR sink, set interpolation to ~41.6


Resample the audio file so that it maches a SR of 4Ms/s with HW 16:

sox input_navtex.wav --rate 2000000 --channels 2 --bits 16 output_2M.wav
